# PhysXCars
 A small PhysX vehicles based car game I made while learning Unreal Engine 4 (Around 2019-2020) 

## Disclaimer
### This is not a finished game, but rather a small project for learning how the engine works. It is VERY old, so don't expect any updates, but I might update it sometime.

## Engine version: Unreal Engine 4.27
